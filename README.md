- Array

   - an operation for testing whether or not a list is empty;.
   - an operation for prepending an entity to a list.
   - an operation for appending an entity to a list.
   - an operation for determining the first component (or the "head") of a list.
   - an operation for referring to the list consisting of all the components of a list except for its first (this is called the "tail" of the list.).
   - an operation for accessing the element at a given index.

- Linked Lists
   - push_back: Add an element to the end of the list.
   - push_front: Add an element to the beginning of the list.
   - pop_back: Remove the last element from the list.
   - pop_front: Remove the first element from the list.
   - insert: Insert an element at a specific position in the list.
   - find: Find the position of an element in the list.
   - remove: Remove a specific element from the list.
   - toString: Get a string representation of the list.
   - findPrevious: Find the element preceding a specific element in the list.

- Queue
   - Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
   - Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
   - IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
   - front: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it.
   - back: Get the value of the back of the queue without removing it.
   - clear: Clear all the given Queue.
   - toString: Print all the given Queue.

- Stack
  - pop: Remove the top element from the stack and return its value.
  - push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - toString: Get a string representation of the stack.
  - clear: Remove all elements from the stack.

- Tree
  - insert: Insert an element into the tree.
  - remove: Remove an element from the tree.
  - findMin: Find the minimum element in the tree.
  - findMax: Find the maximum element in the tree.
  - find: Find a specific element in the tree.
  - getBST: Get the binary search tree (BST) representation of the tree.
  - inOrder: Perform an in-order traversal of the tree.
  - preOrder: Perform a pre-order traversal of the tree.
  - postOrder: Perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
